# Michael O.
Ambitious, dual-major pharmacy student at Long Island University who is also pursuing a Master of Science degree in Artificial Intelligence, as an avid computer programmer of Python, R, and SQL. Currently, I have been adding and refining my past projects to showcase my works that do and do not involve machine learning techniques. I primarily specialze in data analystics in finance and healthcare; however, my year-long project has been analysizing and refining my many iterations of live-trading algorithms on platforms such as Webull and TD Ameritrade (recently). Proficient in Excel, Pinescript, MapleSoft, Javascript, and C++.
